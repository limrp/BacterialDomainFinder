# BacterialDomainFinder

## Description

`BacterialDomainFinder` is a Python-based tool designed for identifying and analyzing conserved protein domains in bacterial genomes. It takes in bacterial genome files in GenBank or GFF format and uses computational methods to identify conserved domains. The tool can also analyze the distribution of these domains across different bacterial species. This project aims to contribute to the understanding of the functional roles of conserved protein domains in bacteria.

## Features

- Parse GenBank or GFF files to extract protein-coding sequences.
- Identify conserved protein domains within the sequences.
- Analyze the distribution of protein domains across various bacterial species.
- Generate a detailed output table containing all relevant information.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Biopython
- Pandas
- Matplotlib (for optional data visualization)

## Installation

Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/BacterialDomainFinder.git
```

Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Command Line Arguments

- `-i, --input`: Path to the input GenBank or GFF file(s). Multiple files can be specified.
  
- `-o, --output`: Path to the output directory where the result files will be saved. If more than one output is generated, they will all be saved in this directory.

### Example

```bash
python BacterialDomainFinder.py -i path/to/genbank_or_gff -o path/to/output
```

## Output

The main output is a table (CSV format) that provides detailed information on each conserved domain found in the input genomes. Additional outputs such as charts or graphs may also be generated for data visualization purposes.

## Future Work

- Implement a web interface for easier user interaction.
- Integrate additional databases for domain identification.
- Add more statistical and machine learning methods for advanced analysis.
